Recent studies confirm that humans respond and react to music and that 
music has a high impact on person’s brain activity. People tend to listen 
to music based on their mood and interests. This project focuses on 
creating a website to suggest songs for user based on their mood by 
capturing facial expressions. Facial expression is a form of nonverbal 
communication. Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that helps 
convey a high-level understanding of digital images or videos to 
computers. In this system, computer vision components are used to 
determine the user’s emotion through facial expressions. Once the 
emotion is recognized, the system suggests a play-list for that emotion, 
saving a lot of time for a user over selecting and playing songs 
manually. Emotion-Based Music Player also keeps track of user’s 
details like, it sorts songs based on category and interest level, and 
reorganizes the play-list every time.

## Features: 

1. User authentication: The user has to be authenticated to access this 
website. (Can login using Social Authentication like Google or

the playlists.
